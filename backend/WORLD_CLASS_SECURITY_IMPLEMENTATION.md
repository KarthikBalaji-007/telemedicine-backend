## **🛡️ SECURITY TESTING & VALIDATION**

### **Automated Security Testing:**
```bash
# Test encryption strength
python -c "
from services.mental_health_security import MentalHealthSecurityService
mh_security = MentalHealthSecurityService()

# Test ultra-secure mental health encryption
test_data = {
    'responses': {'mood_rating': 2, 'anxiety_level': 9},
    'symptoms': ['depression', 'suicidal thoughts'],
    'triggers': ['work stress', 'relationship issues']
}

encrypted = mh_security.encrypt_mental_health_data(test_data)
decrypted = mh_security.decrypt_mental_health_data(encrypted)

print('✅ Mental Health Ultra-Security: PASSED')
print('🔒 Military-grade encryption working')
"

# Test crisis risk assessment
python -c "
from services.mental_health_security import MentalHealthSecurityService
mh_security = MentalHealthSecurityService()

crisis_input = {
    'responses': {'mood_rating': 1},
    'symptoms': ['want to hurt myself'],
    'support_system': 'feeling hopeless'
}

risk_assessment = mh_security.assess_crisis_risk(crisis_input)
print(f'✅ Crisis Detection: {risk_assessment[\"risk_level\"]}')
print(f'🚨 Intervention Needed: {risk_assessment[\"crisis_intervention_needed\"]}')
"
```

### **Security Penetration Testing:**
