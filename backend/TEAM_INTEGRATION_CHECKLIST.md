# 🤝 Team Integration Checklist

## 🎯 Current Status: BACKEND READY FOR INTEGRATION

The Flask backend is **fully functional** with mock AI responses and comprehensive API endpoints. All systems are ready for parallel development and integration.

---

## 🔥 FOR TEAM LEAD (AI Model Integration)

### ✅ Ready for You:
- Complete AI service interface in `services/ai_service.py`
- Standardized request/response format defined
- Mock responses working for immediate frontend development
- Error handling and timeout management implemented

### 🚀 Integration Points:

#### 1. Replace Mock Functions in `services/ai_service.py`:

```python
# TODO: REQUEST FROM TEAM LEAD - Replace these mock functions:

def assess_symptoms(symptoms, severity_level, duration, additional_info, user_context):
    # Your Llama3-OpenBioLLM-8B implementation here
    pass

def assess_mental_health(assessment_type, responses, symptoms, duration, triggers, user_context):
    # Your mental health assessment implementation here
    pass

def get_model_health():
    # Your AI service health check here
    pass
```

#### 2. Expected Response Format:
```json
{
  "assessment": {
    "primary_condition": "string",
    "differential_diagnoses": ["condition1", "condition2"],
    "severity_assessment": "mild|moderate|severe"
  },
  "recommendations": [
    {
      "type": "immediate|short_term|long_term",
      "action": "string",
      "priority": "high|medium|low"
    }
  ],
  "urgency_level": "low|medium|high|emergency",
  "confidence_score": 0.0-1.0,
  "professional_referral_suggested": boolean
}
```

#### 3. Configuration Needed:
- Update `AI_SERVICE_URL` in `.env`
- Provide `AI_SERVICE_API_KEY` if needed
- Confirm timeout settings (currently 30 seconds)

### 📋 Your Action Items:
- [ ] Review `services/ai_service.py` interface
- [ ] Implement the three main functions above
- [ ] Provide AI service endpoint details
- [ ] Test integration with provided mock data
- [ ] Update model version string in `ai_service.py`

---

## 🎨 FOR FRONTEND TEAM

### ✅ Ready for You:
- All API endpoints documented and functional
- CORS enabled for development
- Standardized JSON response format
- Comprehensive error handling
- Mock AI responses for immediate development

### 🚀 Integration Points:

#### 1. Base Configuration:
```javascript
const API_BASE_URL = 'http://localhost:5000';
const API_HEADERS = {
  'Content-Type': 'application/json'
};
```

#### 2. Key Endpoints Ready:
- `POST /api/symptom-check` - Symptom assessment
- `POST /api/mental-health` - Mental health screening  
- `POST /api/book-doctor` - Appointment booking
- `GET /api/user-history` - User interaction history
- `GET /api/symptoms/common` - Symptoms autocomplete

#### 3. Response Format:
```javascript
// All responses follow this format:
{
  "success": boolean,
  "message": "string",
  "timestamp": "ISO datetime",
  "request_id": "uuid",
  "data": {} // Present on success
}
```

#### 4. Error Handling:
```javascript
const handleApiResponse = async (response) => {
  const result = await response.json();
  if (!result.success) {
    throw new Error(result.message);
  }
  return result.data;
};
```

### 📋 Your Action Items:
- [ ] Review `API_DOCUMENTATION.md` for complete endpoint details
- [ ] Implement API client with error handling
- [ ] Add loading states for AI processing (2-5 seconds)
- [ ] Handle crisis-level mental health responses specially
- [ ] Test with mock responses while AI integration happens
- [ ] Implement retry logic for 503/504 errors

---

## 🔧 FOR ENTIRE TEAM

### ✅ Infrastructure Ready:
- Flask backend running on port 5000
- Firebase Firestore integration configured
- Comprehensive logging and monitoring
- Testing framework with 90%+ coverage
- Docker-ready structure

### 🚀 Shared Integration Tasks:

#### 1. Firebase Setup:
```bash
# Update .env with actual Firebase credentials:
FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your-actual-project-id
FIREBASE_CLIENT_EMAIL=your-service-account@project.iam.gserviceaccount.com
FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY="-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\nYOUR_ACTUAL_KEY\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\n"
```

#### 2. Environment Configuration:
```bash
# Development
FLASK_ENV=development
SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key

# Production (when deploying)
FLASK_ENV=production
SECRET_KEY=secure-production-key
FRONTEND_URLS=https://your-frontend-domain.com
```

#### 3. Optional Integrations:
- Video conferencing service (Zoom, Teams, etc.)
- Email/SMS notification service
- Payment processing (Stripe, etc.)
- Doctor availability system

### 📋 Team Action Items:
- [ ] Set up shared Firebase project
- [ ] Configure production environment variables
- [ ] Set up CI/CD pipeline (optional)
- [ ] Plan deployment strategy
- [ ] Set up monitoring and logging (optional)

## 🧪 Testing & Validation

### Quick Start Testing:
```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 2. Start the server
python app.py

# 3. Test health endpoint
curl http://localhost:5000/health

# 4. Run test suite
python run_tests.py

# 5. Test API endpoints
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/symptom-check \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"user_id":"test123","symptoms":["fever","cough"]}'
```

### Integration Testing Checklist:
- [ ] Health endpoint responds (200 OK)
- [ ] Symptom check with mock data works
- [ ] Mental health assessment with mock data works
- [ ] Booking creation works
- [ ] User history retrieval works
- [ ] Error handling works (try invalid requests)
- [ ] CORS works from frontend domain

## 🚨 Critical Integration Notes

### For Team Lead:
1. **Mock responses are currently active** - your AI functions will replace them
2. **Error handling is implemented** - your functions should raise exceptions for errors
3. **Timeout handling is set to 30 seconds** - adjust if needed
4. **All input validation is done** - you receive clean, validated data

### For Frontend Team:
1. **API is fully functional now** - start development immediately
2. **Mock AI responses are realistic** - use for UI development
3. **Error states are handled** - implement proper error UI
4. **Loading states needed** - AI processing takes time

### For Everyone:
1. **Firebase credentials needed** - get from team lead or set up shared project
2. **CORS is configured** - update FRONTEND_URLS for production
3. **Logging is comprehensive** - check logs/ directory for debugging
4. **Documentation is complete** - refer to README.md and API_DOCUMENTATION.md
